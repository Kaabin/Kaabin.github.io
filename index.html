    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
<p> Born into an artistically vibrant household in Tehran, Aeen (also known by his artistic name Kaabin) developed an early and enduring relationship with arts and storytelling. His mother, an actress, introduced him to the language of performance and visual imagination; his father, a poet, immersed him in the intricacies of Persian verse. This dual exposure — language as emotional architecture and performance as lived expression — became foundational to his artistic sensibility.<p>
<p> Aeen’s formal education began with a high school diploma in graphic design, where he learned composition, visual thinking, and conceptual frameworks. His passion for sound led him to pursue advanced study in music at an academic institution affiliated with the Voronezh State Academy of Arts in Russia, known for its comprehensive programs in music theory and performance. However, the Iranian branch of this institution was closed by state authorities due to political repression of arts education, and Aeen did not receive a formal degree. More importantly, he found that the strictures of traditional academic training — especially within a context of censorship — constrained the imaginative potential of his creative voice rather than supporting it.<p>
<p> These early experiences reinforced his belief that artistic practice must be self-directed and exploratory. Rooted initially in Persian classical modes such as dastgāh — a sophisticated modal system in which melodic structures function as emotional and psychological frameworks — Aeen’s musical curiosity expanded through teenage encounters with rock and electronic music. Rather than seeing tradition and experimentation as opposites, he began to conceive of a synthesis: one that preserves the expressive depth of Persian artistic heritage while engaging the textures, pacing, and spatial thinking of contemporary sound cultures.<p>
<p> This synthesis found its most public expression in the formation of Chaartaar, a boundary-defying musical ensemble that became one of Iran’s most compelling contemporary groups. As lead arranger, Aeen crafted the ensemble’s sonic identity — a dynamic convergence of traditional Persian vocal and poetic forms with electronic production, textural depth, and structural rigor. Chaartaar performed extensively throughout Europe and Canada, resonating with international audiences and demonstrating the global communicability of Persian poetic and acoustic sensibilities when recontextualized through contemporary artistic languages.<p>
<p> Following the ensemble’s eventual dissolution, Aeen embarked on an independent artistic trajectory under the name Kabin. His solo work continues to merge poetic narrative, classical modality, and electronic sound design. His compositions — such as Little Dreamland — are characterized by sustained emotional tension, careful pacing, and a structural emphasis on anticipation and affect rather than explicit narrative content.
<p> Aeen’s studio practice now extends beyond sound alone. Cinematic awareness, cultivated from childhood exposure to film and performance, increasingly informs his approach to time, memory, and image. His work seeks to articulate emotional states — suspension, anticipation, endurance, fragility — through the interplay of sound, visual form, and spatial perception.<p>
<p> Today, Aeen’s artistic practice is fundamentally interdisciplinary. Drawing from Persian literary heritage, musical structure, and contemporary media, he creates work that bridges cultural history and experimental inquiry, seeking forms that resonate across linguistic and geographic boundaries.</p>
